## Overview

This project is a Blogs RESTful API built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for the backend. The frontend is implemented using React. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts. User authentication is handled using JWT, and password hashing is implemented with bcrypt.

**Note**: Both the backend and frontend `node_modules` directories have been deleted to avoid large file submissions.
inside both Backend and frontend folders, run the command `npm install .` 
to retrieve the dependancies.
